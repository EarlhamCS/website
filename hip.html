        Earlham's Computer Science Applied Groups provide a structure for students to get paid for consequential work in an educational environment. This means that there is little pre-requisite knowledge. You learn as you work and we are welcome to newcomers of all experience levels. We find that doing work that others depend on makes for a continuous, powerful learning process, so all Computer Science majors are encouraged (but not required) to join an applied group. Additionally, students of another academic focus are welcome to join. </p>

        <p class="lhs">The Hardware Interfacing Project (HIP) implements technological approaches to practical problems on a local scale. For example, Earlham's sustainibility office wished to run a energy conservation contest between the residence halls, so they requested that HIP monitor campus electricity usage with finer granularity and continuously display the measurements in a <a class="project" href="http://proto.cs.earlham.edu/~energy/production/eDisplay/"> pretty graph</a> online (see right). Fulfilling that request involved electrical-hardware work and web-software work. To publicize the results, HIP set up a touchscreen kiosk-style display of this graph in the science building. To emphasize the human role in energy usage rather than set building constraints, HIP is taking various measurements of the dorm buildings and developing an algorithm for normalizing the data accordingly. Although this project involved gear-hacking, mathematics, coding, and design, no one member of HIP was responsible for all areas. In this way, HIP makes space for people of diverse interests and skills to work productively.</p>
